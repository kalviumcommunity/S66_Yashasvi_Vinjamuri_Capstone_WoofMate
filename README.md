# WoofMate

### Project Overview:
WoofMate is an **animal adoption** and care platform that connects potential adopters with rescue dogs, cats and other animals while offering rescue services, donation opportunities, pet care resources, and an AI-powered chatbot for guidance.

### Mission:
Our mission is to connect loving homes with rescue animals while promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.
By integrating AI-powered recommendations, real-time chat support, and rescue services, our aim to bridge the gap between adopters, shelters, and stray animals in need. Our platform is built to empower pet lovers, support rescue organizations, and create a compassionate community dedicated to the well-being of animals.
